## 5. Bug Fix: deltaTime Undefined Error

### User Prompt:
> "We introduced a bug. The moment I start the game after entering the player name, I get a blank screen. Console has this exception: game.js:271 Uncaught ReferenceError: deltaTime is not defined"

### Implementation Summary:
- **Identified root cause**: Power-up collision code placed in wrong method
- **Fixed method structure**: Moved power-up update to main update method
- **Removed duplicate code** from checkCollisions method
- **Fixed ReferenceError** that caused blank screen on game start
- **Maintained proper separation** of collision detection methods
- **Restored game functionality** while preserving new features

**Problem:** Power-up code was in `checkCollisions()` method which didn't have `deltaTime` parameter
**Solution:** Moved power-up logic to main `update()` method where `deltaTime` is available

## 6. Wave Progression Bug Fix

### User Prompt:
> "ok another issue. In wave 8, all the enemy tanks are destroyed, but the game is not progressing to the next wave"

### Implementation Summary:
- **Identified mismatch**: `enemies.length = 8` but `enemiesRemaining = 9`
- **Root cause**: Counter set before spawning, not matching actual spawn count
- **Updated spawn cap** from 6 to 8 enemies (matching spawn positions)
- **Fixed counter logic**: Set `enemiesRemaining` to actual spawned count
- **Added debugging logs** to track spawning and wave completion
- **Ensured wave completion** condition works for all waves

**Problem:** Wave completion condition `(enemies.length === 0 && enemiesRemaining <= 0)` couldn't be satisfied
**Solution:** Set `enemiesRemaining = this.enemies.length` after actual spawning

---

## 7. Syntax Error Fix

### User Prompt:
> "We introduced new bugs. Getting a blank screen at startup. Console has two errors thrown:Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{' (at game.js:144:29)"

### Implementation Summary:
- **Identified syntax error**: Extra closing brace `}` in game.js
- **Fixed class structure**: Removed duplicate brace breaking Game class
- **Restored script loading**: Fixed script chain so Game class is accessible
- **Quick resolution**: Single character fix resolving multiple errors

**Problem:** Extra `}` broke Game class definition
**Solution:** Removed duplicate closing brace
